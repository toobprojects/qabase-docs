# ðŸŒŸ Introduction

Welcome to **QA Base**, a modern, opinionated framework for JVM-based test automation.

QA Base is built to **eliminate the repetitive setup work** that slows down QA engineers. Instead of spending days wiring up WebDriver, RestAssured, Allure, and dependency injection, you get a **production-ready foundation** from day one.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Why QA Base?

- **Zero friction setup**: Skip boilerplate and start writing tests immediately.
- **Batteries included**: Preconfigured integrations with JUnit 5, Allure, RestAssured, and Selenide.
- **Flexible by design**: Works seamlessly with **Java** and **Kotlin** across API and UI testing.
- **Opinionated yet extensible**: Provides sensible defaults but doesnâ€™t lock you in.
- **Proven in practice**: Validated against real-world APIs and full UI workflows (e.g., [automationexercise.com](https://automationexercise.com)).

## ðŸš€ What You Get Out of the Box

- âœ… Clean project structure
- âœ… Dependency injection ready
- âœ… Unified configuration via `application.yaml`
- âœ… Prebuilt modules:
    - `qabase-core` â†’ JUnit 5 + Allure integration
    - `qabase-rest` â†’ REST Assured helpers
    - `qabase-webui` â†’ Selenide utilities for UI automation
- âœ… Built-in reporting with Allure

## ðŸ‘¥ Who Is QA Base For?

- **QA Engineers** who want to start fast without wiring tools manually
- **Teams** migrating to modern test stacks (Java/Kotlin)
- **Automation leads** looking for a consistent foundation across projects
