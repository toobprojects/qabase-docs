# ðŸŒŸ Introduction

Welcome to **QA Base**, a modern, opinionated framework for JVM-based test automation.

QA Base is built to **eliminate the repetitive setup work** that slows down QA engineers. Instead of spending days wiring up WebDriver, RestAssured, Allure, and dependency injection, you get a **production-ready foundation** from day one.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Why QA Base?

- **Zero friction setup**: Skip boilerplate and start writing tests immediately.
- **Batteries included**: Preconfigured integrations with JUnit 5, Allure, RestAssured, and Selenide.
- **Flexible by design**: Works seamlessly with Java and Kotlin across API and UI testing.
- **Opinionated yet extensible**: Provides sensible defaults but doesnâ€™t lock you in.

---

## ðŸš€ What You Get Out of the Box

- âœ… Clean project structure
- âœ… Dependency injection ready
- âœ… Unified configuration via `application.yaml`
- âœ… REST and Web UI utilities
- âœ… Built-in reporting with Allure

With QA Base, you can focus on **writing meaningful tests** instead of fighting with tool setup.
