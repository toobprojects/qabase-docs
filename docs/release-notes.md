# 📝 Release Notes

QA Base follows a **GitHub-driven release process**.  
All official releases are automatically versioned, tagged, and published directly through GitHub.

## 📦 Where to Find Releases

👉 Visit the [**GitHub Releases Page**](https://github.com/toobprojects/qabase-framework/releases) to view:

- ✅ Full list of all released versions
- ✅ Detailed changelogs per release
- ✅ Source code archives
- ✅ Downloadable build artifacts

---

## 🤔 Why Not Keep Notes Here?

We intentionally do **not duplicate release notes** inside the documentation.  
GitHub serves as the **source of truth** for:

- Version history
- Changelog details
- Assets and tagged commits

This ensures the docs remain **clean and lightweight**, while GitHub provides the most up-to-date information.

## 🚀 Staying Updated

- ⭐ Star the [repository](https://github.com/toobprojects/qabase-framework) to get notified of new releases.
- 🔔 Enable “Watch → Releases only” on GitHub if you want release notifications without issue noise.
