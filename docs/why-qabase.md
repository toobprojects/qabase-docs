# ❓ Why QA Base?

Test automation is essential, but setting up the tooling is often **time-consuming and frustrating**.  
QA Base exists to remove that pain and give you a **ready-to-use, production-quality foundation** for API and UI testing.

## 🛠️ Problems We Solve

- **Messy WebDriver setup** → WebUI module uses **Selenide**, preconfigured and version-managed.
- **Boilerplate API testing code** → REST module provides clean, reusable **RestAssured** integration, validated against real-world APIs.
- **Inconsistent reporting** → **Allure reports** are built in and work out of the box.
- **Dependency chaos** → Multi-module Maven setup (`qabase-core`, `qabase-rest`, `qabase-webui`) organizes everything cleanly.
- **Rigid project scaffolding** → Choose **Parent POM** for turnkey setup, or **BOM** for flexibility.
- **Limited language choice** → Full support for **Java and Kotlin** in the same project.
