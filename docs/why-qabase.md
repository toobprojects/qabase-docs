# ❓ Why QA Base?

Test automation is essential, but setting up the tooling is often **time-consuming and frustrating**.  
QA Base exists to remove that pain and give you a **ready-to-use, production-quality foundation**.

## 🛠️ Problems We Solve

- **Messy WebDriver setup** → Selenide comes preconfigured and version-managed.
- **Boilerplate API testing code** → REST module provides clean, ready-to-use RestAssured integration.
- **Inconsistent reporting** → Allure reports are built in and work out of the box.
- **Dependency chaos** → Multi-module Maven setup (Core, REST, Web UI) organizes everything cleanly.
- **Limited language choice** → Full support for **Java and Kotlin** in the same project.
