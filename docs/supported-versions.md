# 🛠️ Supported Versions

QA Base is actively tested and verified against the following platforms:

- **Java 17** — Baseline LTS version (minimum required)  
- **Java 21** — Latest LTS version (fully supported and recommended)  
- **Kotlin 2.1.x** — Latest stable Kotlin releases

---

## 🔮 Future Compatibility

- Non-LTS Java versions (e.g., 18, 19, 20, 22) *may work* but are not officially tested.  
- QA Base aims to follow Java LTS releases closely, ensuring long-term stability.  
- Kotlin compatibility will be updated in sync with stable releases.

---

👉 For best results, use **Java 21 + Kotlin 2.1.x**.
