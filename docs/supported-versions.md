# 🛠️ Supported Versions

QA Base is actively tested and verified in CI pipelines against the following platforms:

| Platform   | Supported Versions              | Notes                                    |
|------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Java**   | 17 (LTS), 21 (LTS)              | 17 is the baseline; 21 is recommended    |
| **Kotlin** | 2.1.x (latest stable releases)  | Full compatibility verified              |
| **Maven/Gradle** | Latest stable versions    | Aligned with JVM + Kotlin compatibility  |

## 🔮 Future Compatibility

- Non-LTS Java versions (18, 19, 20, 22) *may work* but are not officially tested.
- QA Base aims to follow **Java LTS releases** closely, ensuring long-term stability.
- Kotlin compatibility will be updated in sync with new stable releases.

👉 For best results, use **Java 21 + Kotlin 2.1.x**.
